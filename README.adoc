Accumulator-based Clustering Library
====================================


Disclaimer
----------

*This is work in progress.*

The library much far from being usable (but stay tuned ;-)


Overview
--------

Detection of data clusters by searching for pattern unions
in an accumulator.


Key features
------------

* Automatic cluster count detection
* Nested clustering
* Parameter space sub-sampling


Bindings
--------

Python binding will be available.


Build and installation
----------------------

You need C\++ compiler with support for C++11.
Recent enough gcc (4.9) or newer is OK.
You also need make and GNU autotools (automake and autoconf) and libtool.

On Debian-based systems, the following shoud get the above:
----
# apt-get install g++ make automake autoconf libtool git
----

Clone the project:
----
$ git clone https://github.com/vencik/libaccl.git
----

Build and install:
----
$ cd libnn
$ ./build.sh
# make install
----

You may specify your installation prefix using
----
$ ./build.sh --prefix <your installation prefix>
----

The build script runs autogen.sh to create the build environment
(including creation of configure script).
Then passes all its parameters to configure script and if configuration
is succesfull, runs make.

You may get more help on the build configuration by issuing
----
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --help
----

Once the configure script is created, you don't need to run build.sh
nor autogen.sh any more; just the obligatory
----
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
----

The software is available opensource under the terms of 3-clause BSD license.
